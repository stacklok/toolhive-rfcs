# Security Policy

The ToolHive community takes security seriously! We appreciate your efforts to
disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

## Scope

This repository contains RFCs (Request for Comments) and design documents for
the ToolHive ecosystem. While RFCs themselves do not contain executable code,
security considerations in RFC designs are important.

For security vulnerabilities in ToolHive implementations, please report them to
the appropriate repository:

- [ToolHive CLI](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/security/advisories/new)
- [ToolHive Registry Server](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-registry-server/security/advisories/new)

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in an RFC design that could lead to
vulnerabilities in implementations, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive-rfcs/security/advisories/new)
tab.

If you are unable to access GitHub you can also email us at
[security@stacklok.com](mailto:security@stacklok.com).

Include:

- The RFC number and title affected
- Description of the security concern
- Potential impact if the design is implemented as-is
- Suggested mitigations or design changes
