# Build Environment Variables for Protocol Builds

> [!NOTE]
> This was originally [THV-2732](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/blob/a31891dbca93db20ff150b81f778205cb34e5e97/docs/proposals/THV-2732-custom-package-registries.md).

## Problem Statement

Many organizations operate in restricted network environments where downloading packages directly from public registries (npm, PyPI, Go module proxies) is not permitted. These organizations require packages to be downloaded through internal, approved mirrors that:

- Scan and verify packages for security vulnerabilities before allowing access
- Maintain curated lists of approved packages
- Provide an audit trail of package usage
- Operate behind corporate firewalls with TLS interception

Currently, when using ToolHive's protocol builds (`npx://`, `uvx://`, `go://`), packages are always downloaded from the default public registries during the Docker image build phase. This prevents adoption in security-conscious organizations that mandate the use of internal package mirrors.

Beyond package mirrors, there are other build-time configurations that organizations may need to customize, such as memory limits, private module paths, or trusted hosts.

## Goals

- Provide a general mechanism to inject environment variables into protocol build Dockerfiles
- Allow users to configure custom package mirror URLs as a primary use case
- Support any environment variable that package managers or build tools recognize
- Ensure configured variables are always applied during protocol builds
- Integrate with the existing CA certificate configuration for environments with TLS interception
- Maintain backward compatibility for users without custom configuration requirements

## Non-Goals

- Validation that configured mirrors are reachable or functional
- Runtime environment variable injection (this is build-time only)
- Per-MCP-server build environment configuration (global configuration only)

## Architecture Overview

The solution extends ToolHive's configuration system with a new `build_env` section that stores key-value pairs of environment variables. During protocol builds, these variables are injected into the generated Dockerfile's builder stage, allowing users to configure package managers and build tools.

When a user sets a build environment variable (e.g., `thv config set build-env NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY https://npm.corp.example.com`), ToolHive stores this in the configuration file. During protocol builds, all configured variables are passed to the template renderer and injected as `ENV` directives in the generated Dockerfile.

This approach provides flexibility for unforeseen use cases while solving the immediate package mirror requirement.

## Detailed Design

### Configuration Model

Add a new `BuildEnv` map to the configuration:

```yaml
# ~/.config/toolhive/config.yaml
secrets:
  provider_type: encrypted
  setup_completed: true
ca_certificate_path: /path/to/ca-cert.pem
build_env:
  # Package mirror configuration (non-sensitive URLs without credentials)
  NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY: "https://npm.corp.example.com"
  PIP_INDEX_URL: "https://pypi.corp.example.com/simple"
  UV_DEFAULT_INDEX: "https://pypi.corp.example.com/simple"
  GOPROXY: "https://goproxy.corp.example.com"
  # Other build-time configurations
  GOPRIVATE: "github.com/myorg/*"
  NODE_OPTIONS: "--max-old-space-size=4096"

# For authenticated registries: reference secrets by name (values never stored here)
build_env_from_secrets:
  NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY: "npm-registry-url"  # secret contains https://:token@registry
  PIP_INDEX_URL: "pip-index-url"           # secret contains https://user:pass@pypi/simple

# For CI/CD: read from shell environment at build time (names only, no values stored)
build_env_from_shell:
  - GITHUB_TOKEN
  - ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Set a build environment variable
thv config set build-env <KEY> <value>

# View all configured build environment variables
thv config get build-env

# View a specific variable
thv config get build-env <KEY>

# Remove a specific variable
thv config unset build-env <KEY>

# Remove all build environment variables
thv config unset build-env --all

# Set from a ToolHive secret (validates secret exists, stores reference only)
thv config set-build-env --from-secret <KEY> <secret-name>

# Set to read from shell environment at build time (stores name only)
thv config set-build-env --from-env <KEY>
```

### Template Data Extension

Extend `TemplateData` in `pkg/container/templates/templates.go`:

```go
type TemplateData struct {
    MCPPackage      string
    MCPPackageClean string
    CACertContent   string
    IsLocalPath     bool
    BuildArgs       []string
    // New field for build environment variables
    BuildEnv        map[string]string
}
```

### Template Modifications

Add a common block to each template (npx.tmpl, uvx.tmpl, go.tmpl) that iterates over all configured environment variables:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder

{{if .BuildEnv}}
# Custom build environment variables
{{range $key, $value := .BuildEnv}}ENV {{$key}}="{{$value}}"
{{end}}
{{end}}

# ... rest of template
```

This approach means:
- All templates use the same mechanism
- New environment variables work without template changes
- Users have full control over build-time configuration

### Integration with Protocol Handler

The `createTemplateData` function in `pkg/runner/protocol.go` will be modified to read `build_env` from the configuration and populate the `TemplateData.BuildEnv` field.

## User Experience

### Package Mirror Setup

For organizations requiring custom package mirrors:

```bash
# Configure custom CA certificate for TLS interception (if needed)
thv config set cacert /path/to/corporate-ca.pem

# Configure package mirrors
thv config set build-env NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY https://artifactory.corp.example.com/api/npm/npm-remote/
thv config set build-env PIP_INDEX_URL https://artifactory.corp.example.com/api/pypi/pypi-remote/simple
thv config set build-env UV_DEFAULT_INDEX https://artifactory.corp.example.com/api/pypi/pypi-remote/simple
thv config set build-env GOPROXY https://artifactory.corp.example.com/api/go/go-remote

# Verify configuration
thv config get build-env
```

### Other Build Configuration Examples

```bash
# Configure private Go modules
thv config set build-env GOPRIVATE "github.com/myorg/*,gitlab.mycompany.com/*"

# Configure Node.js memory limits for large builds
thv config set build-env NODE_OPTIONS "--max-old-space-size=4096"

# Configure pip trusted host (for self-signed certs)
thv config set build-env PIP_TRUSTED_HOST "pypi.corp.example.com"
```

### Running Protocol Builds

Once configured, protocol builds work exactly as before:

```bash
thv run npx://@modelcontextprotocol/server-github
thv run uvx://mcp-server-fetch
thv run go://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-filesystem-server
```

### Viewing Generated Dockerfile

Users can verify their configuration is being applied using the `build` command with `--dry-run`:

```bash
thv build --dry-run npx://@modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

This outputs the generated Dockerfile with all configured environment variables.

## Security Considerations

### Variable Name Validation

Build environment variable names should be validated:
- Must match pattern `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$` (uppercase letters, numbers, underscores)
- Cannot override critical Docker variables (e.g., `PATH`, `HOME`)

### Value Escaping and Injection Safety

Environment variable values are injected into Dockerfiles using Go template syntax with double quotes:
```dockerfile
ENV {{$key}}="{{$value}}"
```

To prevent shell escape vulnerabilities:
- Values containing double quotes (`"`) should be escaped or rejected
- Validation should check for potentially dangerous characters like backticks, `$()`, and other shell metacharacters
- The template rendering should use proper escaping mechanisms to prevent injection attacks
- Consider restricting characters to alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, forward slashes, colons, and dots for URL-like values

### Secure Credential Handling

For authenticated registries, use `--from-secret` or `--from-env` to avoid storing credentials in the configuration file:

- **`--from-secret`**: References a ToolHive secret by name. The secret value (e.g., `https://:token@registry`) is retrieved at build time.
- **`--from-env`**: Reads from the user's shell environment at build time. Useful for CI/CD where secrets are injected via environment.

URL-embedded credentials (e.g., `https://:token@registry`) are supported by npm, pip, uv, and Go.

### Multi-Stage Build Isolation

All protocol build templates use multi-stage Docker builds. The `BuildEnv` variables are only set in the builder stage and are not inherited by the final image:

| Template | Final Stage Copies Only |
|----------|------------------------|
| npx.tmpl | `node_modules`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` |
| uvx.tmpl | `/opt/uv-tools` |
| go.tmpl | `/app/mcp-server` binary |

Each `FROM` instruction starts a fresh image—ENV variables from previous stages are not inherited. Credentials used during the build phase do not appear in the final container image.

### Audit Trail

Configured build environment variables are logged during builds (with values redacted for security).

## Alternatives Considered

**Specific Package Mirror Fields**: Create dedicated configuration fields for each package manager. Rejected in favor of the general mechanism because it's more flexible, handles unforeseen use cases, and reduces code complexity.

**Environment Variable Override**: Users could set environment variables like `TOOLHIVE_BUILD_NPM_REGISTRY` that get passed through. Rejected because environment variables don't persist across sessions and don't provide centralized configuration management.

**Per-Server Configuration**: Allow specifying build environment per MCP server. Rejected because it adds complexity and doesn't align with the organizational use case where all builds should use consistent configuration.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Configuration Model**: Add to `pkg/config/config.go`:
   - `BuildEnv map[string]string` for literal values
   - `BuildEnvFromSecrets map[string]string` for secret references
   - `BuildEnvFromShell []string` for shell variable names
2. **CLI Commands**: Add `build-env` subcommands with `--from-secret` and `--from-env` flags
3. **Secret Validation**: When using `--from-secret`, validate the secret exists
4. **Template Changes**: Extend `TemplateData` and add environment variable injection block to all templates
5. **Protocol Handler Integration**: Modify `addBuildEnvToTemplate` to resolve values from all three sources
6. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with configuration guide and common examples
