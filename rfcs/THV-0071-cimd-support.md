## Summary

The MCP specification (2025-11-25) defines a clear client registration priority: pre-registered credentials → CIMD → DCR → user prompt. ToolHive currently supports only DCR. CIMD is the spec-preferred mechanism and eliminates the registration round-trip that DCR requires. This RFC adds CIMD support on both sides of the ToolHive proxy: as an authorization server accepting CIMD from MCP clients, and as an OAuth client preferring CIMD when connecting to remote MCP servers.

## Problem Statement

ToolHive currently relies exclusively on Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) for OAuth client registration in two contexts:

- **Embedded authorization server**: MCP clients (VS Code, Claude Code) must call `/oauth/register` before initiating an authorization flow. This is a synchronous DCR round-trip that CIMD would eliminate entirely.
- **`thv run` as OAuth client**: When `thv run` connects to a remote MCP server requiring authentication, it always performs a DCR call to the remote authorization server. If that server supports CIMD but not DCR, `thv run` cannot connect at all.

This is both a **spec-alignment** issue and a **friction-reduction** issue:

1. **Spec divergence**: MCP 2025-11-25 defines CIMD as the preferred registration mechanism. ToolHive skips straight to DCR, the third option in the priority chain.
2. **Registration round-trip**: DCR requires a network call before authorization can begin. CIMD eliminates this step — the client's metadata URL *is* the client identifier.
3. **AS compatibility**: Authorization servers that support CIMD but not DCR would block `thv run` from connecting to those servers entirely under the current implementation.

CIMD resolves these by letting the client host its own metadata at a public HTTPS URL and present that URL as its `client_id`. The authorization server fetches the document on demand — no registration endpoint, no round-trip.

## Goals

- Implement CIMD as the primary OAuth client registration method in ToolHive.
- Allow the embedded authorization server to accept HTTPS URLs as `client_id` values and automatically resolve them to CIMD documents without requiring a prior `/oauth/register` call.
- Allow `thv run` to prefer CIMD over DCR when connecting to a remote MCP server whose authorization server advertises CIMD support.
- Maintain full DCR backward compatibility as a fallback; existing deployments require no changes.
- Enforce mandatory security controls: HTTPS-only, SSRF protection, response size limits, and TTL-based metadata caching.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing DCR entirely — DCR remains a fully supported fallback for authorization servers that do not advertise CIMD support.
- Implementing CIMD for non-HTTP transports (stdio-based MCP servers).
- Client metadata document rotation, versioning, or revocation.
- Multi-tenant metadata document hosting — ToolHive serves a single static document representing itself as an OAuth client.
- Supporting `http://` CIMD URLs in production (only `https://` is permitted; `http://localhost` is allowed in test environments).

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Design

The implementation is delivered in two sequential phases:

- **Phase 1** — `thv run` acts as a CIMD-aware OAuth client: when the remote authorization server advertises CIMD support, `thv run` presents its hosted metadata URL as the `client_id` instead of performing a DCR round-trip.
- **Phase 2** — The embedded authorization server accepts CIMD: MCP clients (VS Code, Claude Code) can present an HTTPS URL as `client_id` and complete the full authorization flow without calling `/oauth/register`.

**Registration priority (`thv run`)**: `stored credentials → CIMD → DCR`

**Registration on the embedded server side**: when a client presents an HTTPS URL as `client_id`, the server fetches the CIMD document on demand and proceeds — no prior `/oauth/register` call needed.

### Detailed Design

#### Phase 1 — `thv run` CIMD client

**`pkg/auth/oauth/cimd.go`** (new file):

Phase 1 introduces the file with only what `thv run` needs — the URL constant and a helper to detect CIMD `client_id` values. The fetch and validate logic is added in Phase 2.

```go
// ToolHiveClientMetadataDocumentURL is the stable HTTPS URL where ToolHive's
// client metadata document is hosted. This URL is the client_id ToolHive
// presents to remote authorization servers that support CIMD.
const ToolHiveClientMetadataDocumentURL = "https://toolhive.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json"

// IsClientIDMetadataDocumentURL returns true if clientID is an HTTPS URL,
// indicating it should be treated as a CIMD client_id rather than a DCR-issued UUID.
func IsClientIDMetadataDocumentURL(clientID string) bool
```

**`pkg/auth/discovery/discovery.go`** (modified):

`AuthServerInfo` gains a new field populated when the remote AS discovery document is parsed:

```go
type AuthServerInfo struct {
    Issuer                            string
    AuthorizationURL                  string
    TokenURL                          string
    RegistrationEndpoint              string
    ClientIDMetadataDocumentSupported bool // parsed from AS metadata
}
```

`PerformOAuthFlow` is updated to follow the new registration priority:

```go
switch {
case hasCachedCredentials(config):
    // reuse stored client_id and refresh token — no registration needed

case info.ClientIDMetadataDocumentSupported:
    // CIMD: use our metadata URL as client_id directly; no registration call needed
    config.ClientID = cimd.ToolHiveClientMetadataDocumentURL

default:
    // DCR fallback
    if err := handleDynamicRegistration(ctx, issuer, config); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
}
```

**`pkg/auth/remote/handler.go`** (modified):

If the AS rejects the CIMD `client_id` with an `invalid_client` error, the handler retries the authorization flow using DCR — graceful fallback per issue #4826 acceptance criteria.

**`pkg/auth/remote/config.go`** (modified):

```go
CachedCIMDClientID string // set when CIMD was used; avoids re-detection on restart
```

**`toolhive-client-metadata.json`** (new static file, checked into repo):

```json
{
  "client_id": "https://toolhive.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json",
  "client_name": "ToolHive MCP Client",
  "client_uri": "https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive",
  "application_type": "native",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "http://localhost/callback",
    "http://localhost:8855/callback"
  ],
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"],
  "response_types": ["code"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

`application_type: "native"` correctly classifies ToolHive as a native CLI application. Two redirect URIs are included: `http://localhost/callback` for port-agnostic loopback matching (RFC 8252 §7.3) and `http://localhost:8855/callback` as a fixed-port fallback. `thv run` binds to port 8855 by default and falls back to an OS-assigned port if unavailable.

#### Hosting the Client Metadata Document

The document above must be publicly reachable at `https://toolhive.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json` **before Phase 1 ships**. This is a hard infrastructure prerequisite — `thv run` cannot use CIMD until the URL is live.

**Serving requirements:**

- `https` scheme only — HTTP is not permitted
- Valid TLS certificate — self-signed is not acceptable; third-party authorization servers will verify it
- HTTP 200 OK on success — any other status code is treated as an error by the fetching server
- Response body must be valid JSON containing at least `client_id` and `redirect_uris`
- `client_id` in the document must exactly equal the serving URL — strict string comparison, no normalization
- URL must contain a path component (e.g. `/oauth/client-metadata.json`), not a bare domain
- `Content-Type: application/json` — `application/<custom>+json` variants are also acceptable per spec, but `application/json` is the conventional choice
- High availability — this URL is on the authorization hot path; downtime blocks `thv run` from authenticating against any CIMD-supporting server

**Note on response size:** The IETF draft recommends document producers keep responses under 5 KB. As a consumer, ToolHive's fetch code enforces a 10 KB hard cap as a defence-in-depth measure to reject maliciously large responses — these are distinct limits with different purposes.

**Note on `Cache-Control`:** The IETF draft says authorization servers SHOULD respect HTTP cache headers when present, but does not mandate any specific `Cache-Control` directive from the server side. The toolhive.dev hosting should set a reasonable `Cache-Control: max-age` (e.g. 300–3600 seconds) to reduce fetch frequency from authorization servers that honour it.

**Permanence constraint:**

The URL is compiled into the `thv run` binary as `ToolHiveClientMetadataDocumentURL`. Changing the URL at any point after release is a **breaking change**: authorization servers that have associated sessions or persisted state with the old URL will treat the new URL as a completely different, unknown client. This URL must be treated as permanent from the moment of first release.

**Scope of this RFC:**

The specific hosting mechanism (static site, CDN, GitHub Pages, object storage) is an infrastructure decision out of scope for this RFC. What this RFC commits to is the URL path and document contents. A separate infrastructure ticket must be opened and resolved before Phase 1 can ship.

#### Phase 2 — Embedded authorization server

The key change in Phase 2 is eliminating the DCR round-trip. The diagrams below show the before and after for a client starting an authorization flow.

**Before (DCR required):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as MCP Client
    participant AS as Embedded Auth Server

    C->>AS: POST /oauth/register {redirect_uris, grant_types}
    AS-->>C: {client_id: "uuid-1234"}

    C->>AS: GET /oauth/authorize?client_id=uuid-1234&...
    AS->>AS: GetClient("uuid-1234") → found in storage
    AS-->>C: redirect to upstream IDP
    Note over C,AS: ... user authenticates ...
    C->>AS: POST /oauth/token
    AS-->>C: {access_token: JWT}
```

**After (CIMD — no registration step):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as MCP Client
    participant AS as Embedded Auth Server
    participant M as Client Metadata URL

    C->>AS: GET /oauth/authorize?client_id=https://vscode.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json&...
    AS->>AS: GetClient("https://vscode.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json")
    AS->>M: GET https://vscode.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json
    M-->>AS: {client_id, redirect_uris, ...}
    AS->>AS: validate + cache → build fosite.Client
    AS-->>C: redirect to upstream IDP
    Note over C,AS: ... user authenticates ...
    C->>AS: POST /oauth/token
    AS-->>C: {access_token: JWT}
```

The interception happens at `GetClient` — the point fosite calls into storage to validate the client during the authorize request. The `CIMDStorageDecorator` wraps this call: if the `client_id` is an HTTPS URL and CIMD is enabled, it fetches the document instead of looking up a registered UUID.

**`pkg/auth/oauth/cimd.go`** (extended from Phase 1):

Phase 2 adds the document type, fetch, and validation logic — only needed when ToolHive acts as the authorization server that receives CIMD `client_id` values from connecting clients.

```go
// ClientMetadataDocument represents a Client ID Metadata Document per
// draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document.
//
// Required: ClientID, RedirectURIs.
// Recommended: ClientName, LogoURI, ClientURI.
type ClientMetadataDocument struct {
    // Required
    ClientID     string   `json:"client_id"`     // must exactly equal the URL this document is served from
    RedirectURIs []string `json:"redirect_uris"` // exact URIs only; no wildcards permitted

    // Recommended
    ClientName string `json:"client_name,omitempty"`
    LogoURI    string `json:"logo_uri,omitempty"`
    ClientURI  string `json:"client_uri,omitempty"`

    // Optional
    TosURI                  string   `json:"tos_uri,omitempty"`
    PolicyURI               string   `json:"policy_uri,omitempty"`
    GrantTypes              []string `json:"grant_types,omitempty"`
    ResponseTypes           []string `json:"response_types,omitempty"`
    Scope                   string   `json:"scope,omitempty"`
    TokenEndpointAuthMethod string   `json:"token_endpoint_auth_method,omitempty"`
    ApplicationType         string   `json:"application_type,omitempty"`
    PostLogoutRedirectURIs  []string `json:"post_logout_redirect_uris,omitempty"`
}

// FetchClientMetadataDocument fetches and parses a CIMD document from rawURL.
// Security controls enforced: HTTPS-only, 10 KB body cap, 5-second timeout,
// SSRF protection via post-DNS IP validation, one-hop redirect limit.
func FetchClientMetadataDocument(ctx context.Context, rawURL string) (*ClientMetadataDocument, error)

// ValidateClientMetadataDocument validates required fields, redirect_uri schemes,
// and enforces self-referential binding: doc.ClientID must exactly equal fetchedFrom.
func ValidateClientMetadataDocument(doc *ClientMetadataDocument, fetchedFrom string) error
```

**`pkg/auth/oauth/ssrf.go`** (new file):

Extracts SSRF protection as a reusable utility. Resolves the hostname via DNS, then rejects if any resolved IP falls within RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1), or link-local (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10) ranges. The check runs against the IP used for the actual connection to block DNS-rebinding attacks. A one-hop redirect limit applies; redirect destinations are subject to the same IP validation.

**`pkg/authserver/storage/cimd_decorator.go`** (new file):

A storage decorator wraps the existing `ClientRegistry` (fosite's `ClientManager` interface) to transparently intercept `GetClient` calls. It checks the inner storage first and fetches a CIMD document only on a miss:

```go
// CIMDStorageDecorator wraps ClientRegistry and handles CIMD client_id values.
// Results are cached in an LRU cache with TTL derived from the Cache-Control
// response header, falling back to a configurable default.
type CIMDStorageDecorator struct {
    base    ClientRegistry
    cache   *lru.Cache[string, cacheEntry] // LRU-bounded; TTL per entry from Cache-Control
    maxSize int                            // default: 256 entries
    ttl     time.Duration                  // fallback TTL when Cache-Control is absent
    enabled bool
    mu      sync.RWMutex
}

func (d *CIMDStorageDecorator) GetClient(ctx context.Context, id string) (fosite.Client, error) {
    if !d.enabled || !cimd.IsClientIDMetadataDocumentURL(id) {
        return d.base.GetClient(ctx, id)
    }
    return d.fetchOrCached(ctx, id)
}

// RegisterClient always delegates to base — DCR clients continue to work.
func (d *CIMDStorageDecorator) RegisterClient(ctx context.Context, client fosite.Client) error {
    return d.base.RegisterClient(ctx, client)
}
```

The decorator constructs a `fosite.DefaultClient` from the fetched `ClientMetadataDocument`. For documents containing `http://localhost` redirect URIs, it wraps the result in the existing `LoopbackClient` (`pkg/authserver/server/registration/client.go`) to enable port-agnostic loopback matching per RFC 8252 §7.3.

**`pkg/authserver/server/handlers/discovery.go`** (modified):

Both well-known endpoints advertise the new capability when `CIMDEnabled: true`:

```go
// Added to AuthorizationServerMetadata (served at both
// /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server and /.well-known/openid-configuration)
ClientIDMetadataDocumentSupported bool `json:"client_id_metadata_document_supported,omitempty"`
```

Advertising in both endpoints ensures clients using either RFC 8414 or OIDC discovery can detect CIMD support and skip the DCR step automatically.

**Embedded auth server configuration** (new opt-in field, default disabled):

```yaml
authServer:
  cimd:
    enabled: false        # opt-in; set to true to accept HTTPS URLs as client_id
    cacheMaxSize: 256     # max number of cached CIMD entries (LRU eviction)
    cacheFallbackTTL: 5m  # TTL used when response carries no Cache-Control header
```

#### API Changes

None. The `client_id` field on OAuth requests is already a string; CIMD URLs are valid string values. No new endpoints are added.

#### Configuration Changes

Phase 1 requires no new configuration — CIMD is activated automatically when the remote AS advertises support. Phase 2 adds the opt-in `CIMDEnabled` flag to the embedded auth server config (see above).

#### Data Model Changes

**Phase 1** — `pkg/auth/remote/config.go` gains:

```go
CachedCIMDClientID string // set when CIMD was used; avoids re-detection on restart
```

This follows the existing persistence pattern for `CachedClientID` (DCR client ID) and `CachedRefreshTokenRef`. It is non-sensitive (a public URL).

**Phase 2** — no new data model changes; the CIMD cache is in-memory within the storage decorator and is not persisted.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

Threats marked **Phase 2** apply only when the embedded authorization server fetches CIMD documents from connecting clients. Phase 1 (`thv run`) does not fetch any CIMD documents — it only presents its own URL as a `client_id`.

| Threat | Phase | Description | Mitigation |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|
| SSRF via CIMD URL | Phase 2 | Attacker presents a CIMD `client_id` that resolves to an internal service | DNS-after-resolve check blocks RFC 1918, loopback, and link-local addresses |
| DoS via large response | Phase 2 | Attacker's metadata server returns an oversized response body | 10 KB body cap via `io.LimitReader` before JSON parsing |
| DoS via slow metadata server | Phase 2 | Attacker serves metadata very slowly to tie up connections | 5-second HTTP timeout on all CIMD fetch requests |
| Metadata spoofing | Phase 2 | Attacker serves a document claiming to be a different client | `client_id` in the document must equal the URL it was fetched from (self-referential binding) |
| Cache poisoning | Phase 2 | Malicious metadata persists in cache too long | LRU cache with TTL from `Cache-Control` header; bounded entry count prevents unbounded growth |
| DNS rebinding | Phase 2 | Domain resolves to public IP for the SSRF check, then re-resolves to private IP for the actual connection | SSRF check performed on the IP used for the actual connection via custom `http.Transport` |
| SSRF via redirect chain | Phase 2 | Metadata server issues redirects to an internal target | One-hop redirect limit; redirect destination subject to the same SSRF IP validation |
| Scope escalation | Phase 2 | CIMD document claims broader scopes than server policy allows | Scopes intersected with server-configured allowed scopes at token issuance |
| Client impersonation | Phase 1 & 2 | Attacker hosts a CIMD document mimicking a legitimate client | `client_id` self-referential binding + TLS certificate validation |

### Authentication and Authorization

CIMD documents are intentionally public — they contain no credentials. Trust is established through:

1. **TLS certificate validation** (Phase 2): All CIMD fetches use standard Go TLS verification; self-signed certificates are rejected.
2. **Self-referential binding** (Phase 2): The `client_id` field inside the fetched document must equal the URL from which it was fetched. A document hosted at `https://example.com/client.json` claiming `"client_id": "https://attacker.com/client.json"` is rejected.
3. **Redirect URI validation** (Phase 2): Before issuing tokens, the redirect URI in the authorization request is validated against the `redirect_uris` in the fetched metadata. The embedded server does not issue tokens to URIs not listed in the document.
4. **Scope enforcement** (Phase 2): The server enforces its own scope policy at token issuance; the CIMD document cannot grant a client access to scopes beyond what the server allows.

### Data Security

- CIMD documents contain only public client metadata. No credentials, secrets, or PII are stored.
- The `CachedCIMDClientID` value (Phase 1) is a public HTTPS URL, treated equivalently to the existing `CachedClientID` (a public DCR-issued client ID).
- The in-memory CIMD cache (Phase 2) stores only the parsed `ClientMetadataDocument` struct — no tokens, no secrets.

### Input Validation

- CIMD URLs must use the `https` scheme. `http://` is rejected except for `http://localhost` in test/development environments.
- Any non-200 HTTP response from the metadata URL is treated as an error and not parsed. ToolHive will not attempt to parse or cache non-200 bodies.
- Response bodies are capped at 10 KB before any parsing occurs. The spec recommends document producers stay under 5 KB; our 10 KB cap is a consumer-side defence-in-depth measure.
- `client_id` in the fetched document must exactly equal the URL it was fetched from — strict string comparison with no normalization.
- JSON deserialization uses `encoding/json`; unknown fields are silently ignored.
- `redirect_uris` must use `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, `http://[::1]`, or `https://` schemes. Other schemes are rejected.
- `grant_types` and `response_types` must be non-empty subsets of server-supported values.

### Secrets Management

No new secrets are introduced by this RFC.

### Audit and Logging

The following log events are emitted:

- `DEBUG` — CIMD fetch initiated (URL only, not full document)
- `DEBUG` — CIMD fetch succeeded (URL, cached=true/false)
- `WARN` — CIMD fetch failed (URL, error); execution continues to DCR fallback
- `WARN` — CIMD `client_id` rejected by remote AS; retrying with DCR
- `INFO` — CIMD used successfully as registration method (URL)

The full CIMD document is never logged; it may contain sensitive contact or policy URIs.

### Mitigations

The SSRF protection logic is extracted into `pkg/auth/oauth/ssrf.go` (introduced in Phase 2) as a standalone utility so it can be reused by any future HTTP-fetching code in the auth layer without duplicating the IP range checks.

## Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

- DCR remains fully functional as a fallback for both the embedded server and the proxy. No existing configuration or deployments require changes.
- The embedded server: CIMD is opt-in (`enabled: false` by default). Existing DCR clients connecting to the embedded server are completely unaffected.
- The proxy: CIMD is used only when the remote AS explicitly advertises `client_id_metadata_document_supported: true` in its metadata. For all other authorization servers, the existing DCR path runs unchanged.
- The `CachedCIMDClientID` field added to `RemoteConfig` is additive; existing persisted configs without this field are loaded without error.

### Forward Compatibility

- `client_id_metadata_document_supported` is a standard field from draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document. As the draft progresses to RFC, field names are not expected to change; we will track the draft and update if needed.
- The `ToolHiveClientMetadataDocumentURL` constant is a single point of change; updating the hosted URL requires only a constant change and a new ToolHive release.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: `thv run` CIMD client support — closes #4826

Delivers complete CIMD support for `thv run` as a self-contained track. ToolHive acts as an OAuth client that prefers CIMD when the remote authorization server advertises support, falling back to DCR otherwise.

> **Infrastructure prerequisite**: `https://toolhive.dev/oauth/client-metadata.json` must be live and serving the correct document before this phase ships. Track via a separate infra ticket opened alongside this RFC.

- New: `pkg/auth/oauth/cimd.go` — `ToolHiveClientMetadataDocumentURL` constant and `IsClientIDMetadataDocumentURL` helper
- New: `toolhive-client-metadata.json` — static metadata document, served from toolhive.dev
- Modified: `pkg/auth/discovery/discovery.go` — parse `client_id_metadata_document_supported` from remote AS metadata; update `PerformOAuthFlow` registration priority
- Modified: `pkg/auth/remote/config.go` — add `CachedCIMDClientID`
- Modified: `pkg/auth/remote/handler.go` — graceful fallback to DCR when AS rejects CIMD `client_id`

### Phase 2: Embedded auth server CIMD support — closes #4825

Begins after Phase 1 ships. Adds the server-side counterpart so MCP clients (VS Code, Claude Code) connecting to ToolHive-managed servers can use an HTTPS URL as `client_id` and complete the full auth flow without a prior DCR call.

This phase introduces the shared CIMD fetch and validation logic (not needed by Phase 1) alongside the embedded server integration:

- New: `pkg/auth/oauth/cimd.go` — extend with `FetchClientMetadataDocument`, `ValidateClientMetadataDocument`
- New: `pkg/auth/oauth/ssrf.go` — SSRF protection utility shared across auth layer
- New: `pkg/authserver/storage/cimd_decorator.go` — storage decorator wrapping `GetClient`
- Modified: `pkg/authserver/server/handlers/discovery.go` — advertise `client_id_metadata_document_supported` in both well-known endpoints
- Modified: embedded auth server config — add `CIMDEnabled` flag (default false)

### Dependencies

Phase 2 begins after Phase 1 is complete.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** (Phase 1): AS metadata parsing with/without `client_id_metadata_document_supported`, `PerformOAuthFlow` priority chain, graceful fallback trigger on `invalid_client`, `CachedCIMDClientID` persistence.
- **Unit tests** (Phase 2): CIMD fetch with mocked HTTP server, HTTPS enforcement, oversized body rejection, timeout, SSRF payloads (private IPs, loopback, link-local, DNS rebinding), self-referential binding check; storage decorator — cache hit/miss, TTL expiry, CIMD disabled path, DCR client unaffected.
- **Integration tests**: Full authorization code + PKCE flow through the embedded server where the client presents an HTTPS URL as `client_id` — verify no `/oauth/register` call is made and tokens are issued.
- **E2E tests**: `thv run` against a mock remote MCP server whose AS advertises CIMD support — verify ToolHive uses the metadata URL as `client_id` and completes the authorization flow.

## Documentation

- New: `docs/auth/cimd.md` — operator guide covering CIMD configuration for the embedded auth server, how CIMD auto-detection works for the proxy, and the static metadata document.
- Updated: `thv run` CLI reference — note that CIMD is used automatically when the remote AS supports it.
- Updated: `docs/arch/` — update the authentication sequence diagram to show the CIMD path.
